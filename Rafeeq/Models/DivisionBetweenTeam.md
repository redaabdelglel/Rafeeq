### **1. Smart Mentor Search Enhancement**
- Replace basic keyword matching with semantic search using OpenAI embeddings
- When mentee searches "I need help with React interviews" → automatically finds mentors with "JavaScript", "Frontend", "Interview preparation" skills
- Combine regular search results with AI-powered semantic matching for better mentor discovery

### **2. Voice Messages in Chat System**
- Voice message recording and playback already available in chat interface
- **Enhancement:** Automatically transcribe voice messages using Whisper API for searchability and accessibility
- **Enhancement:** Display each voice message with an audio player, transcript (speech-to-text), and audio duration
- **Enhancement:** Allow users to search chat history by transcribed voice message content
- **Enhancement:** (Optional) Show waveform visualization and playback speed controls for voice messages


### **3. AI Chatbot Voice Output**
- Add text-to-speech capability to existing AI chatbot responses
- Users can toggle voice output on/off in chatbot interface
- AI responses will be spoken aloud using OpenAI TTS API
- Improves accessibility and user engagement with AI assistant

## **Database Changes Required**

### **Execute These SQL Commands:**

````sql
-- 1. Add mentor embeddings for semantic search
CREATE TABLE MentorEmbeddings (
    EmbeddingId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    UserId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(UserId),
    BioEmbedding VARBINARY(MAX), -- Mentor bio + skills as vector
    LastUpdated DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    CONSTRAINT IX_MentorEmbeddings_UserId UNIQUE(UserId)
);

-- 2. Store AI configuration securely
CREATE TABLE AIConfiguration (
    ConfigId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    ConfigKey NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    ConfigValue NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL,
    ConfigType NVARCHAR(50), -- 'embedding', 'whisper', 'tts'
    IsActive BIT DEFAULT 1,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    UpdatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- 3. Extend existing ChatMessages for voice capability (NON-BREAKING)
ALTER TABLE ChatMessages ADD 
    AudioFilePath NVARCHAR(255) NULL,
    TranscriptText NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    AudioDuration INT NULL;

-- 4. Add user voice preferences (NON-BREAKING)
ALTER TABLE Users ADD 
    TTSEnabled BIT DEFAULT 0,
    PreferredTTSVoice NVARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'alloy',
    VoiceSearchEnabled BIT DEFAULT 1;

-- 5. Cache TTS responses for performance (OPTIONAL)
CREATE TABLE TTSCache (
    CacheId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    TextHash NVARCHAR(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    AudioFilePath NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Voice NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    LastUsed DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- 6. Insert AI configuration
INSERT INTO AIConfiguration (ConfigKey, ConfigValue, ConfigType) VALUES
('openai_api_key', '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', 'general'),
('embedding_model', 'text-embedding-3-small', 'embedding'),
('whisper_model', 'whisper-1', 'whisper'),
('tts_model', 'tts-1', 'tts'),
('similarity_threshold', '0.7', 'embedding'),
('max_audio_duration', '300', 'whisper'),
('tts_cache_enabled', 'true', 'tts');

-- 7. Create performance indexes

CREATE INDEX IX_AIConfiguration_ConfigKey ON AIConfiguration(ConfigKey);
CREATE INDEX IX_TTSCache_TextHash ON TTSCache(TextHash);
CREATE INDEX IX_ChatMessages_AudioFilePath ON ChatMessages(AudioFilePath);

## **Integration Points**

### **Existing Endpoints - NO CHANGES NEEDED**
- All current chat endpoints continue working unchanged
- All mentor search endpoints continue working unchanged
- All user management endpoints continue working unchanged
- All booking endpoints continue working unchanged

### **Enhanced Endpoints - BACKWARD COMPATIBLE**
- `GET /api/users/mentors` - Add optional `semanticQuery` parameter
- `GET /api/chat/{bookingId}` - Add optional `includeTranscripts` parameter
- `POST /api/chat` - Enhanced to handle voice messages automatically

### **Frontend Integration**
- Search component: Add semantic search toggle
- Chat component: Add voice recording button
- AI chatbot: Add voice output toggle
- All features are optional and don't affect existing functionality

---

## **Why This Approach Works**

### **✅ Zero Breaking Changes**
- New columns have default values
- New tables are independent
- Existing API calls work unchanged
- Features can be enabled/disabled per user

### **✅ Minimal Implementation**
- Only 3 core AI features
- Uses existing chat and search infrastructure
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Each feature is independent

### **✅ High Impact**
- **Better mentor discovery** - semantic search finds relevant mentors
- **Modern chat experience** - voice messages like WhatsApp
- **Accessible AI** - voice output for chatbot responses

### **✅ Secure & Scalable**
- API keys stored in database configuration
- File uploads validated and secured
- Audio files cached for performance
- Rate limiting on AI API calls

This plan gives you **3 powerful AI features** with minimal database changes and zero disruption to existing functionality!

## 🗂️ 1. Database Schema (Forum Tables Only)

**Run these queries to add forum support:**

````sql
-- Forum Categories Table
CREATE TABLE ForumCategories (
    CategoryId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(255),
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Forum Posts Table
CREATE TABLE ForumPosts (
    PostId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    UserId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(UserId),
    CategoryId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ForumCategories(CategoryId),
    Title NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    Content NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL,
    IsSolved BIT DEFAULT 0,
    Upvotes INT DEFAULT 0,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    UpdatedAt DATETIME NULL,
    IsDeleted BIT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Forum Comments Table
CREATE TABLE ForumComments (
    CommentId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    PostId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ForumPosts(PostId),
    UserId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(UserId),
    Content NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL,
    IsAnswer BIT DEFAULT 0,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    IsDeleted BIT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Forum Post Upvotes Table
CREATE TABLE ForumPostUpvotes (
    UpvoteId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    PostId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ForumPosts(PostId),
    UserId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(UserId),
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    CONSTRAINT UQ_ForumPostUpvotes UNIQUE(PostId, UserId)
